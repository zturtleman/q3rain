Been working on this game for nearly half a year now and we're nearing public alpha 1.
Still lots to do, there's a few issues code-wise, but it's in a playable state and has the feeling I wanted it to have.
I finally found a neat base to use as a playermodel, need to work on the clothing and do the animations, but it's there. Still missing Barrett, hands, injector and snowboard ingame, tho at least the injector is ready for exporting.
If we don't find any big issues while texturing we should be ready in the next 2 months.

Stay tuned!
