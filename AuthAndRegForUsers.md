# Important #
Do not use any services NOT provided by Hazewood! Your account may be stolen!
Only use binaries from official sources, do not use any webinterfaces except those hosted on hazewood.de!
Your account ist your responsibility, Hazewood cannot be sued for lost acconts!

Stealing accounts, scamming etc. will result in an IP-Rangeban on all official services, including the Rain Master Server and Rain Gaming Server. You won't be able to join any other registration-only servers.

# Privacy #
You are advised to use an unique password in your account, data is of writing that stored as plain text. Administrators will be able to see your password and email!
Hazewood promises not to abuse your password, it will be kept secretly. The file containing passwords will be server-side-read only, access will only be allowed to the master server and administrators. It will only be opened by humans in extreme cases, eg. the master server crashed while writing data and the file gets corrupted. For further security reasons, in such a case users are advised (via email) to change their passwords as soon as possible.


Hazewood will not use your email-adress in any other way than account remove/registration/password change confirmation. You will not receive any other messages.


The only data saved except the aforementioned points is your ip address. Every time you auth to the master server your ip will be transmitted and stored on our server. We need to do this to keep cheaters and misbehaving players off registration-servers.

Playing on any server, being authed or not, will also reveal your ip address to the server owner.

Hazewood is not liable for illegal activities of server admins, but if such cases happen, we will remove the server from the serverlist and saving it's ip in an blacklist.
